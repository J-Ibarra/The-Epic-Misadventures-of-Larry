The Epic Misadventures of Larry. In the year 2041, or as the survivors
call it The year of the last peace. In june 2042 the asgardans descended
on the earth with the intention to destroy every humanoid being. They
seeked for the minerals the planet called earth had. And to do so they
had to destroy the intelligent species and all of its remains. While the
humans were just at the start of a new technological evolution the
asgardans destroyed everything leaving only a few human survivors, and
one of them is Larry! Larry was born in 2041 in the last year of the long
lasting peace. His family lived at a small barn in Australia. They were
just humble farmers when the asgardans descended on the planet. When
larry grew up he didn’t even knew about the massive invasion, by the time
the asgardans reached his barn he was already 20 years old and the rest
of the world was already destroyed. He was a huge geek so he already
prepared for an apocolypse… When the asgardans reached his home he gave a
hell of a fight before ‘heroicly’ commiting suicide,after hundreds of
years some humans were able to discover a machine that would bring the
dead back to life. And so was Larry reborn into the 25’th century. He
suffered from insomnia and therefore the saw the other humans as enemy’s.
After he had killed all the remaining humans he realized that the humans
had brought him back to life. And he decided to destroy every last one of
the asgardans. And here begins the story of the Epic Misadventures of
Larry.

STORYBOARD:
Chapter 1, Larry wakes up in a foreign lab. He was
still confused by the fact that he died in a battle with the asgardans.
The thought that the humens around him were asgardans without realizing
that he was brought back to life.

Chapter 2, After that he killed the
humans he realized that he was brought back to life, and was very
depressed by all the corpses around him. He decided for himself that
their deaths were not for nothing and he wanted to kill every last one of
the asgardans.

Chapter 3, The second encounter with the asgardans was
taking place, he now was destined to destroy every last of them.

Chapter 4, He reached the headquarters of the asgardans wich were in lead of the
operations in Austraila.

Chapter 5, After that he murdered all of the
asgardans in the headquarters he found a hidden message in the ruins.

Chapter 6, He knew where he had to go and to finish it all,so he went to
great brittain where the asgardans had there massive headquarters in lead
of the planet earth.

Chapter 7, he found the headquarters but he
discovered their ultimate weakness (next to bullets, ofcourse…) it was
electrocution and massive explosions(bassicly the same as before but now
with cooler weapons).

Chapter 8, While he was destroying almost
everything around him, he noticed that there was no end to the asgardans
and he would sooner or later fall by the asgardans. So he thought that
there must be a place where the asgardans teleported in form and he had
to destroy it (ofcourse)

destroyed almost the whole headquarters and the teleporters he now was
going to take on the head asgardan called : the ShadowCap(hhahahahahahaahah)
