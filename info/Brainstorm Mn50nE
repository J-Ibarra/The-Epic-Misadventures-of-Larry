This to-do list is  
is completely useless code wise  
In fact  
it just will add more work  
***
First off: gotta have an intro, don't you? Starwars? BOOORING.  
I'd say something cinematic, humor, with awesome music (look at borderlands).
RATM
* Bombrack
* Guerrilla radio

The Prodigy
* Breathe
* Firestarter
* Spitfire

Throw in some drum 'n bass when the shit hits the fan.  
* Rawtekk - Snowflakes (Rawtekk Neuropop VIP)
* Royalston - Kronos
* Pendulum - Tarantula
Characters/bad guys: main part of a game. Don't want 'em to be mutes, do you?  
So... someone... will have to do some... not too terrible... voice acting...  

Now for gameplay... It's got to be possible to tinker with weapons,  
skins, scopes, grips, etc. It however shoudn't be neccacary, and  
shouldn't be in the way.  
Same goes for armor. Maybe implement an auto- equip feature,  
so the game swaps out bad armor/shields/whatever.  

Story  
It shouldn't be all rainbows & roses, people die at war dammit.  
You got to have a character that helps you out, but dies later  
on in the story. Gun idea from Borderlands is quite good,  
so different brands of weapons with their own owners  
(maybe even playable characters) and different specialities.  

Graphics
We're talking pixel art, so basic but close to realism. Slowly scrolling  
wallpaper behind platformer world. [light effects with gunfire and explosions,  
not just on the sprite itself but on enviroment and bad guys and stuff]  
Also: GORE. [Dismemberment, intestines, sounds, blood on enviroment &  
other caracters.]
